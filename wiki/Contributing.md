## Workflow

Progress will be tracked here on Github.  
Google Apps Script is purely for deployment-testing.

There are two telegram bots:

- The main telegram bot, [t.me/hcanoe_bot](https://t.me/hcanoe_bot),
  will always be functional and stable.
- This necessitates a testing bot:
  [t.me/hcanoe_testing_bot](https://t.me/hcanoe_testing_bot).

### Branches

`master`: has to be stable (deployable)  
`dev`: less stable, contains all the newest developments

The `hcanoe/hcanoe-telegram` repo will always only have two branches.
Forks are free to have more.
