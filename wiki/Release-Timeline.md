  secretary)

`v0.0.2`
- talk in group chats
- recognize who sent data from a group chat

`v0.0.3 and on`
- read and write data to attendance Spreadsheet
- logged movements (each edit, each indication of attendance)
- prompt secretary for confirmation 2h after training ends

  - training metadata: day, start time, end time/duration
    (configurable per-secretary!), athlete group, coach present,
    teacher present, type, location

  necessary
