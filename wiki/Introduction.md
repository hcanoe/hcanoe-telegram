The _hcanoe-telegram_ project is a polished interface for students,
coaches and teachers to share and access information required for the
running of the team.

## Motivation

### Data Organization

In recent years, HCanoe moved its operations to Google Drive, and we
have made quantum leaps for our data's collaborativeness and
preservability. However, there is much to improve in organization and
ease of access.

### Data Entry

Creating new instances of data is currently done by manually keying
in to a Google Sheet. This method is not so mobile-friendly and
standardization is difficult.

### Continuity

There is a lack of easily available documentation of what has been
done and how to do things.

## Solution

This project seeks to aggressively organize existing data in order to
achieve the following:

* Simplify maintenance 
* Improve ease of access and analysis
* Increase agility of team operations

The endstate is a team which has successfully managed to automate the
boring stuff, which leaves student-athletes with more bandwidth to
have meaningful interaction, study, and focus more on training.
