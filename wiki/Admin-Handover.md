There are two main things to hand over:
- Google Drive ownership (Google Cloud Console TBC)
- Telegram Bot ownership

#### Telegram Bot Ownership

Get the previous admin to talk to [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
on telegram.

Look up the available commands. There should be one called `/mybots`.

Send that command, and at the main menu under each bot, there should
be a clear option to Transfer Ownership.
